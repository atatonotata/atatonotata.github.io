I"ƒ<p>Every once in a while, the banks bring in their investment customers to give them some market predictions for the next few months. For some reason the bank thinks that I fit this profile perfectly (I guess you can get pretty far in this world by simply being a white, bald male).</p>

<p>Perhaps it‚Äôs due to the geriatric quality of the attendees, but these events are usually frickin‚Äô apocalyptic, predicting the next financial crisis or war.</p>

<p>Last time I went to one of these events was last summer with Nordea, where the focus was on the pending financial crisis that was going to destroy the world by the end of 2019, so there was no surprise that the focus this time around was on war and global politics. Though, because DnB is a not a political analyst institution (or a bank, really; they are a self-proclaimed techonogy company), they invited the Norwegian scholar Asle Toje to cover that topic, making it the highlight of the day.</p>

<p>To summarise, you could say that DnB is banking on the assumption that Trump will not be impeached, and will be re-elected for the next term to double-down on being best. They are also saying that the Middle East is not really that important to global finances, and that the conflict between the Iran and the U.S. is not really going to affect anything. However, the conflict between China and the U.S. is going to escalate over time, perhaps ending in World War III. A reference to Athens and Sparta was made to emphasise this, and how a war between the two greatest powers of Greece was <strong>inevitable<strong>.</strong></strong></p>

<p>There was absolutely no focus on Norwegian industry or local investment opportunities. There was also no talk about tech, start-ups or anything sustainable, which I thought was a shame.</p>

<p>While DnB is spending their efforts trying to recruit more female investors, their time might have been better spent influencing their existing customers to diversify their portfolios in order to stimulate local growth instead. Because, after this seminar, instead of contributing to the local economy, a bunch of old while men will put their money where they are ‚Äúwar safe‚Äù, such as Lockheed Martin.</p>

<p>Either way, we are doomed.</p>
