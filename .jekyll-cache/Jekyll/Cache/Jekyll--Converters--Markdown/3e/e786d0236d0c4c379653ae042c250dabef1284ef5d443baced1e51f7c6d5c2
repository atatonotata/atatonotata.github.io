I"-<p>As the good ‘ol saying goes: “you cannot be a prophet in your own land”, and I can tell you right away that Norway is far from being the exception that confirms that rule. In Norway we have something called the “Law of Jante” – a concept deeply embedded in our socialist souls. If you are not familiar with this concept, look it up, as it explains why Norwegians hates other people’s success.</p>

<p>Well… that’s not quite true. It’s OK for other people to be successful as long as <em>they</em> don’t let us know. Success is proportionately more OK the farther away from us you are, but <strong>no one</strong> would like to see their neighbour hit the jackpot. This explains why you hardly see any fancy cars in Oslo, though there is plenty of cash to go around. It also explains why some of our most successful billionaires sometimes show up in their meetings wearing farmers or fishing clothes, just to make sure you truly understand their roots. In other words, if you are “one of us” you are not allowed to stick out or be different.</p>

<p>That’s why we need people like Matt, an expat from South Africa, which, with his partner Mina, is taking it upon his shoulders to create entertainment for and about the startup industry. This entertainment comes in the form of videos, books, events, shows, and even songs, all facilitated by their media company The Lunicorn, with its HQ in Oslo.</p>

<p>Mina is the Norwegian co-founder of the soon-to-be media empire, and I can only assume she is the brains of the company, as Matt is happily taking the role of being the face. While Matt is taking on the stage, you’ll often find Mina lurking around behind the camera somewhere in the room. Because of this the whole company feels pretty Matt-centric, as, well, the company and all its production is built around his persona.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that if Matt was Norwegian my nationalist heart would have subconsciously judged him according to the Law of Jante, §1-7 and §9-10. However, his foreignality is precisely what makes this concept so good. It makes us feel <em>important</em> and <em>included</em> when a native English speaker talks about our startups. Yes! We are international!</p>

<p>Because, you know what? We’ve been hosting our startup events in English for years now, even if the entire audience is Norwegian. It’s like we’ve been waiting for an international audience to show up, then, boom, Matt is here and we get to use the English we’ve practising for so long. <em>(No, we didn’t get an English audience – we became the audience – but English is spoken for</em> <em>practical</em> <em>reasons for refreshing a change.)</em></p>

<h2 id="the-show">The Show</h2>
<p>At the end of the day The Lunicorn threw a memorable night where we all got to meet up and have some fun. The show itself was inspired by classic game shows, spiced up with short, funny video clips where Matt played all the roles. Heck, there even was a house band to make the transitions smooth.</p>

<p>The first half of the show was a head-to-head battle between the startup hubs Epicenter and Startup Campus, where representatives from the two hubs had to answer awkward questions about how well they knew each other, followed by a “pitching competition” where they had to pitch silly startups as if they were the founders. For the second part of the show the founder of Tise and the former CEO of Tidal entered the stage for a “cosy couch conversation” about their journeys.</p>

<hr />

<p>I think the entire startup community of Oslo owes Matt &amp; Mina a grand thank you for their contributions to the ecosystem. There is a lot of things happening in the startup scene of Oslo these days, but no one is bringing us together for a night of fun where we get to take a step back and laugh at ourselves.  Thank you.</p>
