I"}<p>Every first Friday of the month <s>StartupLab</s> <a href="https://www.forskningsparken.no/events/Eventkalender/" target="_blank">Oslo Science Park</a> invites for coffee and pitches.</p>

<p>When it comes to entrepreneurship it can be hard to separate Oslo Science Park from <a href="http://startuplab.no/" target="_blank">StartupLab</a> – especially when it comes to startups. StartupLab is usually responsible for everything startup related in-house, so there might be some confusion when the house invites us to watch startup pitches from StartupLab without StartupLab being involved.</p>

<p>However, don’t let my temporary confusion confuse you! Oslo Science Park is a great space that houses a ton of really exciting companies. Most of them are seriously tech-heavy hardware-based laboratory facilities.</p>

<p>Seeing some of these senior companies pitch next to freshly hatched startups is a quite nice way to see the diversity of two generations of tech companies under the same roof.</p>

<p>I think this is important because the startup scene tends to be a fairly close-knit community of youngsters, and not very approachable by the already anti-social PhD’s at the lab, and vice versa.</p>

<p>It’s a great initiative, and a great way to start the weekend. Make sure to <a href="https://www.forskningsparken.no/events/Eventkalender/" target="_blank">join</a> the next event!</p>
