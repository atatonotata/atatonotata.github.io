When I walked into this event I had no idea what was in store for me. While most startup events find place in grimy garages, desperately “keeping it real”, <a href="https://katapultocean.com/" target="_blank">Katapult</a> is going the more old school gala style with enough free champagne to keep everyone on a buzz.

But, of course, nothing less was expected for this grand event. Katapult is, after all, perhaps the only programme in Norway with the power of attracting startups from all over the world to participate. This is quite impressive as Norway might not seem like the most sexy scene at the first glance, as it’s rather expensive here, the working culture can be painfully conservative, investors hardly ever write 7 digit checks, and, well, we’ve hardly been able to foster any startup success stories. 

Inviting startups to come _here_ feels somewhat almost absurd, as the startups of this glorious kingdom are being repeatedly drilled to find their markets outside of the Norwegian borders. This, of course, makes sense if your customers are people and your currency are users, because there is only so far you can go in this country. Take <a href="https://tise.com/" target="_blank">‘tise</a>  for example: an excellent app for selling second hand clothes. They have a million users in Norway – which is pretty much every girl between 18 and 24, meaning that they have maxed out their market already.

Anyways, the startups at Katapult Ocean are, believe it or not, companies that work with the ocean in one way or another. As part of the Katapult system the companies also have to be impact oriented, which is pretty cool. And I guess it’s this context that makes Norway an attractive place for these startups as our entire economy has been based on offshore activities for the last millennium or so. In addition to this we have a fractal shaped coastline that would stretch around the galaxy twice when stretched out, or something like that, so there should be plenty of opportunities for these startups to play around.

Personally ocean-tech is quite far from my domain of expertise as it tends to be pretty hardware based and I’m a software guy, but even my mind got blown away by some of these companies. In general you could say that the quality of the companies was so high that there was something in it for everyone, and I do indeed some of the Norwegian investors took the opportunity to was some bad ocean consciousness of their hands by investing in some of these startups. 

Of the twelve companies that presented on stage, these grabbed my attention:


## Algalife (Israel)
Most Israeli startups are not fucking around, and Algalife is no exception. They’ve created a new fabric from algae, and it looks gorgeous! You can either mix the material in fabric production, or you can go pure algae if you like. Cotton, their main competitor, takes tons of fresh water, fertilisers and chemicals to produce, making the algae option quite attractive.

## Oceanium (UK)
Again, a company that invented a new material from the not-so-usable goodies of the ocean. These guys figured out a way to make all sorts of packaging material from seaweed, finally giving plastic some real competition.

Because it’s quite stupid to think about the fact that food packaging, such as the plastic like condom that’s on your cucumber, is going to hang around for a thousand years. 

No, it’s not the first time that we’re trying to make biodegradable alternatives to plastic. Corn and mushrooms are two well explored candidates for the job, but there are some problems coming with these solutions: they replace food production, primarily in poor countries. That’s why this company is so interesting, as they are not threatening the balance of the system we have today. They are adding without taking.

There is no doubt too much plastic waste, and if it was up to me it would be illegal for food producers to use plastic packaging all together. We simply don’t need it.

## SaNoor Technologies (US of A)
What? Did you say America? An American startup in Norway? Gosh! What an honour!

Anyways, this is a seriously cool company, and it really talks straight to me nerdy heart. They are enabling underwater WiFi (or LiFi if you like to use correct terms). Yes, we’re talking cordless internett under water, baby. Their technology use laser to transmit data, and it opens up a sea of opportunities for all sorts of underwater IoT. This can be useful when monitoring underwater infrastructure, platforms, fish farms, etc. The opportunities are endless.

At the end of the day it was a great night, and it's one of the few events that even attracts some minor local industry celebrities, such as Martin Schütt of Askeladden, Johan Brand of Kahoot and Maria Amelie - the entrepreneurial author that hussled her way to a norwegian citicenship back in the days.

I cannot wait to see what the next batch have in store!
