For those who don't know TheFactory, let me introduce you to Oslo's FinTech-hub, formerly located at Fornebu, but now situated in the heart of Oslo.

But, before I go on, let me make it clear that TheFactory is _way_ more than just a mere hub, as they are more of an incubator and an accelerator. Heck, they even snatched the price as the best accelerator/incubator program by the Nordic Startup Awards last year, so there is no reason not to have your eyes glued to this hot spot. 

I don't know that much about the inner clockworks of this co-working space, nor am I an expert in financial technology, but I do like the smaller startup-hubs in Oslo, such as this one. They seem to manage to create a campus-like feeling and as well as a real internal culture where magical things like peer-to-peer learning spontaneously occurs. This, you might say, should be obvious for any startup oriented co-working space, but let me tell you, my friend, that strangers talking to each other is _not_ obvious in this glorious kingdom. _(For those uninitiated in scandinavianism it normally takes a barrel of booze for us to muster up the courage to have a conversation with a stranger, though when it finally happens it often ends with sex.)_

To my ignorant mind, up until just a few years ago, I saw FinTech as robots buying and selling stocks on the market at the speed of light, skimming sick profits from micro transactions, a game I thought it would be hard to play as you kind of need a lot of data and processing power for your robot to win the bling.

However, now that I’m more of an educated man, I know that FinTech, like any of the other (fill-in-the-blank)Tech’s, is a diverse umbrella covering tons of different subjects, making it as exciting to explore as any of the other fields of tech. And what better place to explore this than at the one and only TheFactory demo day, where they get to show off their alumni as well as the latest batch of their accelerator program of the fall!

I really like their little space down in the city, but I do think that Nordea’s headquarters at Majorstuen was the perfect venue for the event of the night. Most of all I think that hosting this event is great marketing for the bank, which seems to establish itself as the preferred partner for the hot startup-scene of Norway, showing a great example by sponsoring TheFactory as well as being one of the main partners of the <a href="https://www.sheconference.no/" target="_blank">SHE Conference</a>.

Nordea is playing the game with the right mindset, and I’d like to give a tiny shoutout to Liina T. Aagedal, the Innovation Lead of Nordea, and the woman responsible for the good reputation the bank enjoys among the startup-companies of Norway. Great job! We need more people like you.

Anyways, the format of the pitches was quite nice as they showed off only 10 companies; 6 alumni and 4 startups from the accelerator program of the fall.

Here is a very short breakdown of what went on stage:
