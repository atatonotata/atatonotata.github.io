excerpt: Every first Friday of the month <s>StartupLab</s> Oslo Science Park invites for coffee and pitches.<br/><br/>When it comes to entrepreneurship it can be hard to separate Oslo Science Park from StartupLab – especially when it comes to startups. StartupLab is usually responsible for everything startup related in-house, so there might be some confusion when the house invites us to watch startup pitches from StartupLab without StartupLab being involved.

Every first Friday of the month <s>StartupLab</s> <a href="https://www.forskningsparken.no/events/Eventkalender/" target="_blank">Oslo Science Park</a> invites for coffee and pitches.

When it comes to entrepreneurship it can be hard to separate Oslo Science Park from <a href="http://startuplab.no/" target="_blank">StartupLab</a> – especially when it comes to startups. StartupLab is usually responsible for everything startup related in-house, so there might be some confusion when the house invites us to watch startup pitches from StartupLab without StartupLab being involved.

However, don’t let my temporary confusion confuse you! Oslo Science Park is a great space that houses a ton of really exciting companies. Most of them are seriously tech-heavy hardware-based laboratory facilities.

Seeing some of these senior companies pitch next to freshly hatched startups is a quite nice way to see the diversity of two generations of tech companies under the same roof.

I think this is important because the startup scene tends to be a fairly close-knit community of youngsters, and not very approachable by the already anti-social PhD’s at the lab, and vice versa.

It’s a great initiative, and a great way to start the weekend. Make sure to <a href="https://www.forskningsparken.no/events/Eventkalender/" target="_blank">join</a> the next event!
