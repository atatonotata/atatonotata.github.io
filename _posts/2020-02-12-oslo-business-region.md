title: Oslo Business Region&#58; Building the Oslo Startup Ecosystem
excerpt: Oslo Business Region (OBR) is a great organisation that is actively contributing to build the Oslo startup ecosystem with initiatives such as Oslo Innovation Week. They also represent Oslo at larger international events, such as South By South West and SLUSH.<br/><br/>Normally you would not see the people behind OBR on stage, as they are all about showcasing entrepreneurs and startups. This event, on the other hand, was slightly different as they presented some of the key numbers from their freshly published annual report. This report sort of puts Oslo's entire startup scene in context, with yearly developments of the industry.

Though money flows like liquid gold in our black rivers of climate killing oil, we have been very conservative when it comes to investing in software. While we're pouring money into oil and shipping innovation, we don't really have any tradition of making IP-related value.

Through 'Innovation Norway', pretty much anyone with a good idea can get a bit of funding ($10-15k) to explore their ideas. After that, you are expected to do a seed round of up to $500k before you hit the big bucks in your Series A, where you're going to look for about $2m. In other words, we are expected to achieve the same success as American startups with about 10% of the funding, which is stupid.

In order to create a truly vibrant startup scene in Norway and really become a serious exporter of technology, we need to see more investments all-around. 'Angel Challenge' is also doing its part by creating a culture of angel investments -which is awesome- but we also need more generous seed investments to get some really nice Series A rounds. The problem, however, is that Norway is still in the toddler stage and we have no real exits to show. We have no investors that got 100x ROI, and, sadly, we have no founders flying around in a pink Hello Kitty private jet. Because of this, the local VC firms are struggling to finance their next funds, and the companies they invest in are growing slower than they should.

However, what OBR is pointing out in their report is that we've had a very positive trend in Oslo over the past few years. The amount invested in startups in Oslo increased by 50% from 2018 to 2019, including some "real" Series A rounds last year, where more than 10 companies received between $10m and $20m.

So, no, we have not yet had our unicorn here in Norway, but with these kinds of investments it for sure will happen within a year or two.
