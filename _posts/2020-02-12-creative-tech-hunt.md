<a href="http://www.657.no/" target="_blank">657</a> have been the co-working space for creative technologies in Oslo since 2012, making it one of the original gangsters of the Oslo startup scene.

While other co-working spaces tend to mix startups with corporates, such as Mesh and WeWork, 657 offers a nice mix of startups, freelancers and small agencies, making it an intimate space for creative heads.

Traditionally 657 have been hosting the Norwegian branch of the international concept <a href="https://cbnet.com/cup/" target="_blank">Creative Business Cup</a>, where startups from all over the world compete against each other for the noble title of being the most creative company.

However, it’s no longer called Creative Business Cup in Norwegian, as it’s been translated to the slightly more sexy name <a href="http://www.657.no/creative-tech-hunt/" target="_blank">Creative Tech Hunt</a>. However, it seems to pretty much be the same thing, as the winner of the Hunt will be going to Copenhagen to participate in the Cup… 

Anyways, I’ve always had a soft spot in my heart for creative industries as they tend to solve _fun_ problems. I’ve been going to a lot of the Creative Business Cup events over the years and I’ve seen a lot of weird stuff. And, perhaps it’s just that the startup-scene of Oslo is maturing, or perhaps it was just a good batch this time around, but I really got impressed with the quality this time.

For a starter they had Mr. Johan, one of the founders of <a href="https://kahoot.com/" target="_blank">Kahoot!</a>, to give an inspirational talk before the pitches. I thought this was a nice touch because there are so many people talking about how to make it as a startup from Norway, but so few people with the actual hands on experience. Kahoot! is a great story, and perhaps the only startup from Norway that ever got to experience hyper growth.

Ah, well, let’s not dwell on the past and embrace the future instead! There was some seriously cool companies showing off their latest tech, and I got impressed. Here are my favourites of the night:



## Dwarfheim
As a true nerd I frickin’ love computer games, and I always let myself get impressed when some new, underfunded and inexperienced company embark on the epic journey it is to create a fully fledged game. It’s an incredibly competitive space where your MVP pretty much have to be production ready. It’s also a space where the biggest companies, like Nintendo and their staff of thousands, often miss their deadlines by a year or more due to the insane amount of things that will go wrong.

However, that does not seem to scare Pineleaf Studio, the creators of Dwarfheim, as they have made a medieval world for us to dwarf around in. The game itself will be released on Steam, where 40.000 people already have the game on their wish list. That’s an impressive number, and I cannot wait to see how the community receives the game.

## Costail
First of all, humans are one of the few animals that don’t have a tail. Think about it; fish, birds, most reptiles and mammals all have tails. It’s pretty much only chimps, gorillas and us that don’t have them, which is totally unfair.

That’s why I love this company so much. I’m usually no sucker for hardware, but this company is actually making autonomous tails for humans. Yes. Tails. Tails that move around in a natural way, counterbalancing your sway as you walk, making it look all natural. It’s the ultimate cosplay gadget, or the perfect gift to whomever that already “have everything”. If you are an investor and think that this is a marginal market, I can inform you that they informed me that if cosplay was a religion, it would be the worlds 5th largest religion.

If it was up to me, Costail would have won the whole <s>cup</s> **hunt**, but unfortunately they came second… however, as the winner of the **hunt** is not qualified to participate in the **cup** as they have received too much funding, they are sending the Costail company to compete for Norway in the **cup** finals in Copenhagen in March.

## Voisey
Music is far from my domain, and I simply don’t understand the success Tidal, the business model of Spotify, or the meaning of Apple Music. But, what I do understand is when a <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/a-year-after-selling-catalog-stargate-invests-in-voisey-app-calling-it-the-future-of-songwriting/" target="_blank">hit machine studio invests in a small startup from Bergen</a>, you are dealing with something that is steaming hot, and that’s what’s going on as Stargate invested in Voisey. 

If you don’t know who Stargate is, I can inform you (aka. quote form Wikipedia) that they have produced or written for Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, Lionel Richie, Jessica Simpson, Britney Spears, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Selena Gomez, Samantha Mumba, Mis-Teeq, Atomic Kitten, Blue, Janet Jackson, Shakira, Jennifer Lopez, Sam Smith, Mary J. Blige, Ne-Yo, Katy Perry, Coldplay, P!nk, Sia, Kylie Minogue, Carly Rae Jepsen, Wouter Janssen, Mustard, Justin Bieber, Rob Fusari, Khalid, Charli XCX, Lindsay Lohan and others.

If you don’t know who Voisey are, I can inform you that there is only a matter of time before I can quote Wikipedia to explain. But, until then I will try on my own: it’s an app where you can create and share beats on your phone, establishing a new social network for music people. With their audio processing technology they enable users to achieve excellent quality by singing into the headphone microphones. Each video is of a maximum of one minute long, forcing the users to focus on hooks rather than full tunes.

If Stargate is right this is the future of songwriting, and I don’t judge the judges of the Creative Tech Hunt for giving Voisey the victory of the competition, as they will make a nice trophy on the wall of 657.
